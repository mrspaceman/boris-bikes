About
----------
Skeleton scala-based project for the **Data Engineering Training guide**
 at Scott Logic.

There are 2 datasets in use.
Each has its own top level package, and each with its own md file with
the instructions, tips and hints.

You are encouraged to commit your solutions to a **new branch** and
compare with others.

The initial exercises can be found in the *boris_bikes.md*

### boris-bikes
The boris-bikes dataset consists of route information from
Londonâ€™s public bicycle hire scheme (Boris Bikes, Santander Cycles).

### chess
The chess dataset consists of about 1 million real games of chess taken
from lichess.org
